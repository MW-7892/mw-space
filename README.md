# ✨ MW-Space
An introduction website of M-W (me)!

This will be develop with Next.js on my free time. The website itself is quite static, but I took this as an opportunity to learn some Next.js framework as well!

## 🎯 Purposes
* Experiment with my website designing skills.
* Include this webshite in my CV to show that I can make a website.
* Learn how Next.js works.

## 🤔 Design Considerations
* Moderate to low abstraction layer, try to implement the UI from low-level as much as possible.
* Optimized, shouldn't take too long to load.
* Aesthetic but simple. The website should looks good but doesn't use too many fancy effects.
* Intuitive design. I mostly guessed which design is "intuitive," so it might not be optimal, but should be as easy to understand as possible.
